## Heading level 2

I think I'll use it to format

Keep lines left-aligned like this.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

This text is ***really important***. 

> Hola que tal
> - Hola que tal <br
>
>
> *Everything* is going according to **plan**

1. hola
2. hola
3. hola

other line
